\title{Compute log-density of multivariate normal distribution with mean zero
and covariance matrix Sigma at vector x, returning also U = L^-1
This function computes the log-density of a multivariate normal distribution
with mean zero and covariance matrix Sigma at point x, and also returns
the matrix U = L^-1 where L is the lower triangular matrix from the Cholesky decomposition of Sigma.}
\usage{
logdmvn_arma_with_U(x, Sigma)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector representing the point at which to evaluate the density}

\item{Sigma}{A positive definite covariance matrix}
}
\value{
A list containing the log-density value at point x and the matrix U
}
